## How to Use

1. Upload an image of a dog
2. Click "Submit"
3. View the predicted breed and confidence score

## Tips for Best Results

- Use clear, well-lit images of dogs
- Ensure the dog is the main subject of the image
- Try to capture the dog's face and body clearly
- Avoid images with multiple dogs or other animals
- Use images where the dog is in a natural pose

## Limitations

The current version of the classifier has some limitations:

- It can only recognize the five breeds it was trained on
- It may struggle with mixed breeds
- Image quality and lighting can affect accuracy
- Unusual poses or angles may reduce confidence
- The model may be confused by similar-looking breeds
